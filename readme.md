# Monorepo of my Rust projects, while learning

## I'm learning RUST

Things I built in order:

1. Recursive rock paper scissors
2. Axum web service with error handling
3. Tic Tac Toe, but the computer guesses the Toes

PS this is difficult, thankful for github copilot for learning the syntax with me.
